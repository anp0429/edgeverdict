"""Render a PR comment from an edgeverdict --json-out artifact (schema v1).

Usage: python3 scripts/render_pr_comment.py run.json > comment.md

Design position (deliberate, do not "improve" away):
- The evidence is the product. Confirmed gaps show the failing test source
  and its observed output so a maintainer can judge in seconds.
- Everything that is not a confirmed gap is collapsed. broken_test,
  skipped_covered, and handled details are edgeverdict's bookkeeping, not
  the maintainer's problem.
- Advisory only. This renderer never suggests blocking anything.
- test_code and observed are nullable (skipped_covered findings never
  generated a test); render must not assume strings.
