"""Per-file review — one focused reviewer call per changed file.

WHY (measured + reasoned):
  - One call over the whole 34k diff spreads the model's attention across ~10
    files; a rare case (composite FK) surfaced 3/5. Cost is also one big prompt.
  - Reviewing each changed file in its OWN call keeps every change (nothing
    omitted — the failure of "scope to one file") while giving each file a
    focused, cheaper prompt. Focus may also lift coverage of rare cases.

HONEST LIMIT: per-file review catches per-file bugs. A bug that only appears when
file A's change interacts with file B's needs a whole-change pass. The critic
(optional, below) is that pass. So: per-file for depth, one whole-change critic
pass for cross-file gaps.

Nothing about the GATE changes. Findings from all files are merged and each is
verified the same deterministic way.
