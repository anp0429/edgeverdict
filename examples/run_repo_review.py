"""Iteration one: a backend persona and an SRE persona review a real repo.

The verifier runs the repo's actual pytest suite on every proposed change. The
outcomes below are not staged — they were measured against the real suite:

  * backend tightens MATCH_TOL 60 -> 15  -> the suite goes RED -> REJECTED,
    with the real failing test as the reason. The world said wrong.
  * SRE appends a planned scale-relative constant -> GREEN -> committed.
  * backend and SRE both retune ATTACH_TOL, to 50 vs 12 -> both GREEN -> the
    tests cannot adjudicate a precision-vs-robustness call -> CONFLICT, the
    human gate decides.

Usage (point REPO at a clone of the repo under review):
