"""The review pipeline, end to end.

    intent  ->  ReviewerAgent (GPT derives behaviors + writes tests)
            ->  FindingVerifier (runs each test on the branch, classifies)
            ->  render_review_html (the audit board)

Set your key:  export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
Then:          python examples/run_review.py

The intent is DATA (an issue URL or a string) — the agent is generic.
The agent is NOT told what to look for. The honest question this answers:
does it independently propose the composite-FK case (and others), and does the
gate confirm which are real gaps?

keyed by each issue's path elements. When a path element collides with an
Object.prototype member (toString, constructor, hasOwnProperty, __proto__),
the tree-building lookup `curr[el] || {...}` picks up the INHERITED prototype
member instead of creating a fresh node, so formatting throws (or corrupts
the tree) for schemas whose field names are prototype keys.

PR (the claimed fix): replace the truthiness lookup with an own-property
check (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call) so a fresh { _errors: [] } node
is always created for path elements that are prototype keys, at every depth
of the path. Behavior for ordinary field names is unchanged."""
