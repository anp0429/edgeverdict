# How prove spent its first day: breaking itself

July 22, 2026. The `prove` subcommand was written in one evening: an
agent (or a human) changes code, `agentboard prove` tries to break the
change, and the output is a failing test you can run, or "tried,
executed, couldn't." Before merging it, we pointed it at its own
uncommitted diff. This note is the ledger of what happened, because it
turned out to be the best argument for the tool.

## Round one (run fingerprint 94669614e770c539)

70 proposed behaviors across 4 changed files. 14 executed to a verdict,
21 were recognized as already covered by the repo's own tests, 33 broke
before running (the reviewer model hallucinated imports and fixtures —
including borrowing a helper from our test files without defining it —
and the gate killed every one; a broken proposal cannot manufacture a
finding). 7 confirmed gaps, each an executed failing test.

Triage: 4 real, 2 false positives, 1 judgment call.

The real ones:

1. **The classifier could fabricate false positives.** `classify_failure`
   decided "assertion" by checking whether the string "AssertionError"
   appeared anywhere in the failure report. A crash whose traceback
   merely mentioned that string became a confirmed gap. This bug sat in
   the verdict path's plumbing — the exact component whose honesty the
   whole tool depends on — and the tool found it in itself. The fix
   classifies by the exception actually raised, read from the report's
   raising line or pytest's location tail.
2. Import matching for test discovery could be fooled by import-looking
   text inside docstrings, and couldn't see multiline aliased imports.
   Fixed by matching real AST import nodes instead of text.
3. An `__init__.py` target produced the stem `test___init__.py`, a file
   nobody has ever written on purpose. Fixed: the package directory's
   name is the stem.
4. A run where nothing executed printed STOPPED but exited 0. Fixed:
   the exit code and the verdict line always tell the same story.

The false positives were themselves informative: one was a NameError
wearing a confirmed-gap costume — put there by bug #1, and flagged
likely_false_positive by the advisory auditor before we knew why.

Every fix landed with the gate's own failing scenario converted into a
permanent regression test.

## Round two (run fingerprint ff36b2226dfda3eb)

Same command, a few hours later, against the fixes. Gaps went 7 to 5;
behaviors recognized as covered went 21 to 47, because round one's
regression tests now preempt half the reviewer's ideas. Of the 5, four
were real again — and one was a hole in that day's own fix:

1. The new classifier checked timeout wording before exception identity,
   so an assertion whose message legitimately mentioned "timed out"
   classified as a timeout. The reviewer found the flaw in the patch
   within hours of the patch. Order fixed: an identified AssertionError
   wins outright.
2. Injection deduplicated imports by text match at any indentation, so a
   local import inside a test body could be silently deleted, rewriting
   the proposal. Now only column-0 duplicates are stripped.
3. Test-title extraction used a regex over raw text and could pick a
   docstring example that looks like a test def. Now the title comes from
   the AST.
4. Class-based test proposals needed the class-qualified node id
   (`TestX::test_y`) for exact serial selection. Same AST fix.

The fifth was an opinion about output formatting, kept in the specimen
jar for the assertion-quality work.

## Round three (run fingerprint e4a011add5ff924c)

The first fix of the trust layer was giving the reviewer the target's
real import surface — module path plus public names, read from the AST —
after 33 and then 29 proposals had died of hallucinated imports in the
first two rounds. The next self-review ran with that data in the prompt:
**zero broken proposals.** Every test the model wrote imported correctly,
executed, and reached a verdict. One prompt line of deterministic facts
retired the entire failure class.

And then the recursion went one turn deeper: with imports finally
working, the freed-up proposals interrogated the newest function in the
repo — `import_surface` itself — and found five real gaps in its model
of "importable," every one flagged likely_real by the advisory auditor:

1. Annotated constants (`ENABLED: bool = True`) are bindings; the first
   version only read plain assignments.
2. Tuple and compound assignments (`FIRST, SECOND = 1, 2`) bind every
   name; the first version saw none of them.
3. Lowercase public names (`router = APIRouter()`) are exactly what real
   tests import; an ALL-CAPS filter excluded them.
4. A package `__init__.py`'s re-exports (`from .mod import Thing`) are
   the most common public surface in Python packaging; imports were
   ignored entirely.
5. Namespace packages (PEP 420) have no `__init__.py`, so requiring one
   at every level truncated `company.product.feature` to a path that
   does not import.

Our own unit test had blessed `src.pkg.mod` as a module path; the review
corrected the test too — `pkg.mod` is what pip installs. All five fixed
the same hour, each with the review's scenario as a regression test.

## Round four (run fingerprint 6e0f5bfb428f68c7)

Written after the post that says "sixteen," because the tool did not stop
when the story did. The next board: zero broken proposals again — the
import surface holds — and four more likely_real gaps, now in Python's
darker binding semantics. A module-level `for` or `with` target persists
as a module global and belongs on the surface; a top-level `del` removes
a binding the surface was still advertising; a top-level walrus
(`name := ...`) binds a real global; and a path with a non-identifier
segment produced a truncated module path stated with full confidence,
when the honest output is no surface at all (unless the cut lands at a
src/lib source root, which is self-contained). The same board verified,
approvingly, that exception-handler aliases are correctly absent because
Python itself deletes them after the handler. The reviewer is reading
the language spec at this point. Running total: twenty.

## Round five, and the twin (run fingerprint c6b038372514ff65)

The fifth board: zero broken proposals for the third consecutive run,
and six gaps. Five were real, all low-severity completeness misses in
`import_surface`'s model of module-scope binding: a non-identifier
filename stem produced a confident wrong path; a deleted-then-rebound
name stayed deleted; a tuple `del (A, B)` slipped past a Name-only
check; a walrus inside a function's default expression (evaluated at
module level) went unseen; and bindings created inside module-level
try/if bodies were invisible to a top-level-only walk. The sixth was
the auditor's third catch: a proposal asserting the substring `' i'`
against a prose sentence, flagged likely_false_positive — specimen
three for the assertion lint. This round also forced a policy: gaps
that can cause false verdicts or wrong prompt facts block merge;
completeness misses in advisory aids are logged and fixed in course.
All five were fixed the next morning by rewriting the collector as a
recursive module-scope walker. Running total: twenty-five.

And one find the tool gets only partial credit for: its pytest
classifier bug taught us what to grep for, and the grep found the same
substring pattern in the vitest classifier — the harness that ran the
benchmark and every upstream finding. Every published claim survives
it (all were hand-reproduced, with repros in the issues, and the bug
direction can only inflate gaps, never certify bad code), but it was
a live false-positive generator and is now fixed the same way:
classification by the error in raising position, with the crash-that-
quotes-"AssertionError" case as a permanent test.

## The second language (PR #7, fingerprints below)

Weeks later, `prove` grew a TypeScript lane, and the same machine that
gated its birth gated its growth six more times. Catch 6 built a TS
export-surface extractor to match the Python one; the after-measurement
came back worse, not better, which overturned its own premise: the ufo/
ohash broken-proposal class was never invented imports; it was
stripped-but-needed ones. The vitest harness removes proposal imports
by design, and the routed host file did not bind the name. Catch 6b
fixed it by merging verified imports into the host header instead of
dropping them, proven by executing a real proposal inside the real ufo
repo. That measurement, run to produce a launch number, debugged the
feature before it could ship a false improvement.

Then self-review found six more, defects 26 through 31, board by board:

- 26: the Python module-scope walker descended every compound statement
  except `match`, so case-body bindings and capture patterns were
  invisible. (Fingerprint e6ecaf785f9bbc67, from the earlier PR #6
  board; fixed here.)
- 27: the TS surface added names from `export { x } from './missing'`
  without resolving the source. A re-export from a module that cannot
  load is a name that cannot be imported. A wrong prompt fact, the first
  blocking-class gap the gate ever raised against its own code.
- 28: aliased proposal imports (`import { a as b }`) could never merge,
  because the parser kept only the local name and verified the wrong
  side against the export surface.
- 29: the import merge ate the host file's trailing newline, making a
  re-merge non-idempotent.
- 30: the same unresolved-source lie as 27, one branch over: a
  namespace star re-export (`export * as ns from './missing'`) added
  `ns` unconditionally.
- 31: an ambient `export declare namespace X {}` leaked into runtime
  importable names, though it emits no runtime binding; the extractor
  ignored the `declare` modifier.

Two of these were non-test guardrails doing the same job: the CI
typecheck blocked the merge on three mypy errors in the new code,
caught before a human looked. Self-review kept going past
the shapes real repos ship, into exotic re-export corners the regex-grade
extractor does not yet handle; those are logged in
notes/ts-surface-limits.md rather than fixed, by the same rule, because
the surface is an aid to the proposer and can only weaken a proposal,
never manufacture a false gap. The merge was ruled by that rule, not by
chasing the board to empty.

## The ledger

Thirty-one real defects found by the tool in and around its own code
across the birth of `prove` and the growth of its TypeScript lane, plus
one latent twin the tool taught us to grep for. Broken proposals went
33, 29, 0, 0, 0 as the first rounds taught the proposer its own repo,
and the TS lane's import-caused broken class went 9 to 0 once the merge
landed. Every defect is a named test in the suite.

Severity, for the skeptic, because "31 bugs" flattens a distribution
that shouldn't be flattened: seven were verdict-path or evidence-
integrity or wrong-prompt-fact defects — the two substring classifiers (a false-positive generator in
each harness), injection silently rewriting test bodies, title
extraction selecting the wrong test for serial execution, STOPPED
exiting 0, a mid-run failure discarding executed evidence, and the
unresolved-source export lie (defect 27) that would have told a proposer
to import a name no module exports. Those are the ones that matter, and
they are why this tool exists. The rest are completeness misses in a prompt aid that was
days old when reviewed — real, fixed, and labeled advisory by our own
merge policy. A fair reading of this ledger is: the tool found six
serious defects in its own honesty machinery and then relentlessly
polished a new helper; both halves are true, and the fingerprints let
you check which is which.

The merge of the `prove` feature was blocked, by rule, until the tool's
own verdict on its own diff came back clean of real gaps — prove gated
its own birth, and then kept gating its own growth.

None of this required trusting a model's opinion. Each finding above was
a test that compiled, ran, and failed against the real code, and each
fix was proven by the same mechanism. That is the whole thesis of the
tool, demonstrated on the least flattering codebase available: ours.
