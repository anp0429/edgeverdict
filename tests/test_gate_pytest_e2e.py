"""End-to-end gate test, Python edition -- "edgeverdict can gate Python".

The structural twin of tests/test_gate_e2e.py: the REAL FindingVerifier,
driven by the REAL PytestHarness, against a real pytest project
(tests/fixtures/py_target) with one planted clamp bug, producing all four
verdict classes from actual process execution:

    handled        <- a proposed test the tool already satisfies
    confirmed_gap  <- a proposed edge test exposing the planted clamp bug
    broken_test    <- a proposed test that references an undefined name
    timed_out      <- a proposed test that sleeps past the subprocess limit

Then the whole run repeats from scratch (fresh warm base) and the verdict
fingerprint must be byte-identical. Same product claim as the JS file, new
runtime: same suite, same target, same verdicts, any run.

The profile is built through config.build_profile, not by hand, so this
also proves the detection path end to end: pytest.ini -> kind "pytest" ->
python profile -> PytestHarness selected from the profile.

Two timing notes. There is no npm install here (the python profile assumes
the running environment provides pytest -- it is running this very file),
so a run costs seconds. And the hanging proposal exercises the design's
worst case on purpose: pytest has no per-test timeout, so the BATCH hits
the subprocess limit, every finding falls back to the proven serial path,
and the hang then times out its own serial run. The verdicts must come out
identical anyway.
