"""The review board must never default into the reviewed repo.

Regression for a real dogfooding bug: the board defaulted to
./review_board.html in the reviewed repo's cwd, so a `git add -A` committed
it, and on the next review that 270-line HTML file became a 19k-char "diff"
that starved the reviewer to zero behaviors. The default now lives in the
system temp dir; an explicit --board still wins."""
