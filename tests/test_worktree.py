"""Worktree mode: the diff and the sandbox must describe the same facts.

`load_worktree_diff` exists because an agent mid-session has dirty,
uncommitted edits — the exact state `load_pr_diff` (refs only) cannot see
and the exact state the sandbox copytree DOES execute. These tests pin the
boundary between the two modes, and the preflight inversion that goes with
it (dirty tree: blocker in refs mode, the point of the run in worktree
mode)."""
