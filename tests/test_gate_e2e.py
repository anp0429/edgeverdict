"""End-to-end gate test — the classifier meets a real test runner.

tests/test_determinism.py proves the JUDGMENT path is pure against frozen
runner output. This file closes the remaining gap: the REAL FindingVerifier,
against a REAL vitest project (tests/fixtures/demo_target), producing all
four verdict classes from actual process execution:

    handled        <- a proposed test the tool already satisfies
    confirmed_gap  <- a proposed edge test exposing the planted clamp bug
    broken_test    <- a proposed test that references an undefined name
    timed_out      <- a proposed test that never resolves (1s vitest limit)

Then the whole run repeats from scratch (fresh warm base, fresh install)
and the verdict fingerprint must be byte-identical. That is the product
claim, executed: same suite, same target, same verdicts, any run.

Requires node + npm on PATH and network for one `npm install` per run;
skipped cleanly where the toolchain is absent.
