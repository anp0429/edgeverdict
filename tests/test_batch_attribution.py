"""Batch attribution must be spoof-proof.

The batched gate marks each proposal's title with a predictable token
(___ab<i>___) and maps results back by substring match on the executed
title. The marks are guessable, so a proposal could carry another finding's
mark in its OWN title and hijack that finding's verdict — e.g. a failing
test titled "... ___ab0___ ..." minting a confirmed_gap for finding 0. The
gate strips anything mark-shaped from proposal code before adding its own
marks, so the only mark in any executed title is gate-injected. These tests
pin that with a simulated vitest run (no node, no sandbox install)."""
