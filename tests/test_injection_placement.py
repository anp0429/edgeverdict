"""Injection placement is decided by the LAST top-level opener, not by
whether a describe exists anywhere in the file.

Benchmark row 6 (jotai tests/vanilla/store.test.tsx) is the regression this
file pins: describes early in the file, top-level it() calls at the end. The
old rule ("any describe anywhere -> insert before the final close") nested
all 10 proposals inside the final it's body, where `-t` filtering meant they
never registered — 10/10 "injected test did not run (name match failed)".
EOF-append at module scope was proven against jotai's real environment
before the rule was changed.
