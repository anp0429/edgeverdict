"""Gaps that fail in unison are one cause, not N bugs.

Found on supabase/mcp#324: nine "confirmed gaps" in one run all read
"Target cannot be null or undefined." — every generated test unwrapped the
tool response with the wrong shape and hit the same null. An operator who
trusts a 9-gap report files nine bogus findings and torches their
credibility. The deterministic pass these tests pin: verbatim-identical
failure messages across >= 3 confirmed gaps get an artifact_note and a
run-level warning; statuses never change (the tests really did execute and
fail — the gate does not un-say that), and distinct messages are never
merged.
