"""The gate's failure classifier must never let a non-assertion mint a gap.

A confirmed_gap is the product; its worth rests entirely on "a real test ran
and its assertion failed." The old heuristic classified any failure message
containing the substring "expected" as an assertion failure — and
"Unexpected token" (a parse error) contains "expected", so a garbage test
could be scored as a confirmed gap. These tests pin the conservative rule:
only a named AssertionError is an assertion; everything else that isn't a
timeout is the test's problem, not the tool's.
