"""Model-to-provider routing, in ONE place.

The rule: a model whose name starts with "claude" talks to Anthropic; every
other model talks to an OpenAI-COMPATIBLE endpoint. The second bucket is
deliberately open. gpt-*/o* reach api.openai.com by default, and setting
OPENAI_BASE_URL points the same client at any compatible server (Ollama,
LM Studio, vLLM), which is how local models wire in with zero new config
surface: name the model in .edgeverdict.toml, export OPENAI_BASE_URL, done.

This used to be `model.startswith("gpt") or model.startswith("o")` pasted
into four files, which routed every non-OpenAI, non-Claude name (qwen,
devstral, ...) to the Anthropic client, where it could only fail. Same
lesson as the failure classifier: shared rules get one brain, or they
drift. Encode the rule, not the vendor list.
