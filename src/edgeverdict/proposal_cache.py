"""Proposal cache — pay for sampling only when the inputs changed.

The pipeline has two very different halves. The gate is deterministic and
runs in seconds; the propose side (reviewer + critic) is sampled, costs real
tokens, and takes minutes. When NOTHING it reads has changed — same intent,
same diff, same source, same tests, same models, same harness notes — a
rerun buys nothing but a different sample of the same coverage space. This
cache makes that rerun free: verdicts are always re-executed live; only the
PROPOSALS are reused.

Honesty rules, because coverage is a sampling process by design:
  * The cache NEVER silently prevents resampling — every hit prints its key,
    and `fresh=True` (or EDGEVERDICT_FRESH=1) forces a new sample and
    overwrites the entry. The human decides when to pay for new coverage.
  * Only proposal-side fields are stored (behavior, axis, coverage read,
    test code). Verdict fields (status, observed, audit) are per-gate-run
    facts and are never cached — a loaded finding always starts "pending".
  * The key covers every byte that feeds either prompt. Change one character
    of the diff and the key changes; a stale hit is structurally impossible.
