"""edgeverdict — a code review gate that verifies by executing tests.

A model proposes edge-case tests from your intent and your change; a
deterministic harness runs each one against the real code in a clean
checkout; a behavior is a gap only if its test runs and fails. No model is in
the pass/fail decision. The entry point is the `edgeverdict` CLI
(`edgeverdict.cli:main`).

The legacy whiteboard/loop API (built on LangGraph) now lives under
`edgeverdict.experimental`; its top-level aliases below are still importable
from this package, but only when the optional `whiteboard` extra is installed
(`pip install "edgeverdict[whiteboard]"`). It is not needed for the review
gate, so a lean install does not pull LangGraph, and the imports below degrade
to absent rather than crashing `import edgeverdict`.
