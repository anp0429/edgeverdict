"""MCP adapter — edgeverdict as a tool a coding agent can call.

The engine's machine boundary is the schema_version-1 JSON artifact
(api._write_json_out). This server is a THIN adapter over that boundary,
exactly like the GitHub Action: it builds the same ReviewRequest the CLI
builds from its parsed flags, runs the same api.run_review pipeline, and
returns the parsed artifact. No review logic lives here; if the CLI and
the MCP server can disagree, one of them is wrong.

Design positions, same as everywhere else in this codebase:

* Advisory, never blocking. The tool RETURNS verdicts; it does not raise on
  confirmed gaps. The calling agent (and ultimately a human) decides what a
  gap means. Errors are for "the review could not run", never "the code is
  bad".
* stdout belongs to the MCP protocol. The pipeline narrates through an
  injected log sink (api.run_review's `log`); every line is collected into
  a per-call buffer and returned in the artifact's `log` field, because a
  stray print() on stdio IS protocol corruption. No global stdout redirect:
  two concurrent calls cannot cross-contaminate each other's narration.
* Worktree by default. An agent calling this mid-session has dirty,
  uncommitted edits — that is the thing it wants gated. `worktree=False`
  restores the CLI's refs mode (head vs base).
* Intent is required. The gate needs to know what the change is MEANT to do,
  and the calling agent knows its own intent better than any commit-message
  heuristic. No silent derivation here.

Run: `edgeverdict-mcp` (stdio). Requires the `mcp` extra:
`pip install "edgeverdict[mcp]"`.

    Reviews `target` (path relative to `repo`) against `intent` — a plain

    WORKING TREE (your uncommitted edits, diffed against `base` or HEAD),
    which is the mode to use mid-session before committing. Pass
    worktree=False to review committed refs (head vs base) instead.

    Returns the schema_version-1 run artifact. Read it like this:
    `confirmed_gaps` is the count of behaviors where a proposed test ran and
    failed its assertion against your code — each such finding carries the
    test source (`test_code`) and the assertion output (`observed`), so the
    evidence is reproducible. `broken_test` findings are the proposer's
    failures, not yours. A non-empty `env_error` means nothing was executed
    and no verdict below it is real. `audit` annotations are advisory
    second-model opinion; they never change a verdict.

    Args:
        repo: absolute path to the git repo.
        target: file the change touches, relative to repo.
        intent: what the change is meant to do (one or two sentences).

            default: the branch fork point).
        head: refs mode only — the ref to review (default: current branch).
        worktree: review on-disk working tree (default) vs committed refs.
        axis: "default" or "security" (biases proposals toward adversarial
            input; the gate is unchanged).
        no_audit: skip the advisory false-positive auditor.
