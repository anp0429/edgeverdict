"""edgeverdict.graph: blast-radius scoping via code-review-graph.

EDGEVERDICT_GRAPH_WRAPPER_V3 (grep signature)

Design rules (locked):
- This is the ONLY module in edgeverdict allowed to import code_review_graph.
- Every public function degrades gracefully when the package is missing or a
  call fails. A review must never die because the graph did.
- The gate stays the star. This module only answers "which files."
- Test-gap detection is deliberately NOT computed here. "Has tests" is
  decided by edgeverdict's own tests-autodetect at the CLI layer, so the
  --scope test-gaps dial reflects what the gate can actually execute.
  Where useful, pass that logic in via the gap_probe callback.

Verified against the installed code-review-graph on 2026-07-17:
- get_impact_radius: sync, lives in code_review_graph.tools.query, returns
  keys [changed_files, changed_nodes, context_savings, edges, impacted_files,
  impacted_nodes, status, summary, total_impacted, truncated].
- The sync build core is build_or_update_graph in
  code_review_graph.tools.build (confirmed by the wrapper's own probe on
  first live run). The async build_or_update_graph_tool in main.py is only
  the MCP layer; we never import main.py (it would drag in fastmcp).
- postprocess is a STRING: "full" | "minimal" | "none".

Graph persists at <repo>/.code-review-graph/graph.db (SQLite, in-repo,
auto-gitignored), so builds are build-once, update-incrementally.
