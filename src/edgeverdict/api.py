# EDGEVERDICT_PERPAIR_PROFILE_V1
"""The library boundary for a review run — one callable, two adapters.

cli.review() used to be the only entry point, so the MCP server had to fake
an argparse Namespace and redirect global stdout to reuse it. That redirect
was process-wide state: two concurrent MCP calls would cross-contaminate
each other's captured narration. This module is the fix at the root:

* ReviewRequest is the real API surface — a dataclass whose fields mirror
  the CLI parser's review namespace one-for-one. The parity test in
  tests/test_mcp_server.py trips the day a CLI flag lands without a field
  here, exactly as it used to trip on the faked namespace.
* run_review(request, log=...) is the whole pipeline. Every human-facing
  line goes through the injected `log` callable (print-shaped), so an
  adapter chooses its own sink: the CLI passes print, the MCP server passes
  a per-call buffer. No global stdout is ever redirected.

The verdict logic is unchanged: this file orchestrates; the gate decides.
