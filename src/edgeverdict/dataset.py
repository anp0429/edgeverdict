"""Dataset collector: every review is training data.

The gate is a reward function with no model in it, so every finding is a
labeled example: the inputs the proposer saw, the test it wrote, and the
executed verdict. This appends one JSONL row per finding to a growing corpus.
It changes NO verdict logic; it is a pure side effect of a run.

Why this exists: the propose side is the model's job and the gate side is a
verifiable, execution-grounded label. That pairing is exactly the signal
reinforcement-learning-from-verifiable-rewards needs, and it is produced for
free on every run. Collecting it from day one means the corpus is already
large when the model work (roadmap Phase A/C) begins.

Design rules, each load-bearing:
  * Facts only, no reward shaping. Store the executed status and the advisory
    audit; let the trainer decide the reward later. The one honest,
    model-free label is `ran` (did the test execute): true for handled and
    confirmed_gap, false for broken_test, null for skipped_covered/timed_out.
  * Append-only JSONL, one row per finding, so the corpus grows across runs
    and streams line by line without loading the whole file.
  * Explicit, never silent. Writing is opt-in and prints where it wrote,
    because quiet data collection is exactly what this project refuses to do.
  * The advisory audit is stored but never used to relabel `ran`. A model's
    opinion does not overwrite an executed fact, same rule as everywhere else.
