"""TestRepairer — one bounded repair round for broken proposals.

A broken_test is the PROPOSER'S failure, never evidence about the code —
but every broken proposal is also a lost attempt at breaking the change,
and self-review runs showed the loss at scale (33 proposals dead of
hallucinated imports in one run before the import surface existed).

This agent gets ONE round: it is shown the proposal, the exact error
that killed it, and the target's real import surface, and may fix ONLY
the test's setup — imports, names, fixtures it defines itself. It is
explicitly forbidden from changing what behavior the test asserts,
because a repair that weakens or retargets the assertion would let the
repairer quietly rewrite the reviewer's intent.

THESIS GUARD: the repairer never assigns a status. A repaired proposal
re-enters the same FindingVerifier as any other candidate and earns
handled / confirmed_gap / broken_test by execution. A proposal that
breaks twice stays broken. One round, hard cap, off-switch
(ReviewRequest.no_repair) — cost stays bounded and the narration says
exactly what happened.

HARD RULES:
- Do NOT change what behavior the test asserts. The assertion's meaning \
is the reviewer's intent and is not yours to edit. You may rename a \
variable or import path; you may not weaken, strengthen, retarget, or \
delete an assertion.
- Import the target ONLY via the module path and public names given in \
the IMPORT SURFACE. Never invent private helpers or other module paths.
- Any fixture or helper the test needs must be defined INSIDE the test \
code you return.
- Return ONLY the corrected test code. No prose, no markdown fences.

exactly: CANNOT_REPAIR"""
