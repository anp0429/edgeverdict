"""tldraw adapter — the seam, stubbed honestly for v0.2.

Implements the ``WhiteboardAdapter`` protocol (same single ``project`` method as
the working HTML adapter). It is intentionally not finished: the point of v0.1 is
to prove the seam exists and is type-correct, not to ship half-tested API calls.

  - tldraw: map each Proposal/Conflict/Rejection to a tldraw shape record and
    write a .tldr document (tldraw's persisted snapshot format). tldraw is the
    intended zero-account interactive default once the shape mapping is pinned to
    a tldraw version.
