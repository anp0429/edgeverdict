"""PeerReviewer — a SECOND model, used as a disagreement detector.

The thing to be ruthless about: two LLMs agreeing does not make an answer
correct. It makes it popular among models trained on the same internet.
Agreement cuts variance, not error. So this component is NOT a vote and NOT a
gate. Correctness was already settled by the deterministic verifier
(red-on-baseline / green-after / no-regression). A model never overrides that.

What a second model is genuinely good for is the question the deterministic gate
*cannot* answer: not "is this change correct?" but "is this change worth
asserting — does it actually address the intent, is the test meaningful?" That
is taste, and taste is exactly where models legitimately differ.

So the reviewer does one honest thing: it asks an INDEPENDENT model (must be a
different model than the one that proposed) for an agree/disagree on each
already-accepted proposal, and turns *disagreement* into a ``Conflict`` on the
board. We do not average conflicts away — edgeverdict surfaces them. High-severity
disagreement trips the human gate. Agreement is logged and the proposal proceeds
(the deterministic gate already passed). Nothing is ever accepted *because* a
second model liked it.

Structure mirrors ``openai_agent``: the model call and the parsing are split, so
``parse_review`` is a pure, offline-testable function with no network.
