"""The seams. Everything swappable in edgeverdict implements one of these.

Four protocols, three of them the seams that make the library generic in
*mechanism* while staying narrow in *purpose*:

    IngestionAdapter  — raw source        -> verified Nodes
    Agent             — a persona         -> Proposals        (behavioral skill)
    Verifier          — proposals         -> accepted / rejected   (EXTERNAL check)
    WhiteboardAdapter — snapshots         -> a board you can open

The Verifier is the load-bearing one. It is deterministic and external on
purpose. An LLM grading its own answer is theatre — models rationalise their own
mistakes. So verification lives outside the generative path: a schema, a stated
constraint, or (v0.2) a geometric invariant. It rejects *falsehood*, never
*taste*. "Is this fix wired to a node that actually exists?" is checkable.
"Is this a good idea?" is not, and no verifier should pretend otherwise.
