"""The pytest spelling of the gate — same semantics, Python runtime.

Everything FindingVerifier believes still holds here: only a test that
actually runs and fails its assertion is a gap; a crash is the test's
problem; a hang is a human's problem. This module only answers the
framework questions for pytest:

  - injection is EOF-append at module level. Python has no describe-block
    scoping problem: module scope is always legal, host imports and helpers
    are in scope, and a later `def` never nests inside an earlier one, so
    the whole placement decision tree the vitest harness needs collapses to
    one rule.
  - proposal imports are KEPT, not stripped. Unlike ES modules, a Python
    import is legal at the injection point, and a proposal often genuinely
    needs one the host lacks (`from order_tool import clamp_page_size`).
    Only exact duplicates of lines the host already has are dropped.
  - results come from pytest's junit XML (--junit-xml), parsed with stdlib
    ElementTree — machine-readable without adding a dependency. The JSON
    plugins would be nicer; they would also be a new runtime dep, which the
    gate does not take.
  - serial runs select by NODE ID (file::name), not by -k expression: a
    node id matches exactly one collected test, so a name that happens to
    be a substring of a pre-existing test can never drag that test's
    failure into this finding's verdict. Batch runs use -k on the gate's
    injected marks, mirroring the vitest -t filter.
  - timeouts are the SUBPROCESS limit's job. pytest has no per-test
    timeout without a plugin (a new dep), so a hanging proposal times out
    the batch, everyone falls back to serial, and the hang times out its
    own serial run -> timed_out. Slower than vitest's in-runner timeout,
    same verdict, same determinism.

Classification is the conservative rule, pytest edition: only a failure
whose report names AssertionError counts as an assertion. pytest's assert
rewriting raises AssertionError for every bare `assert`, and the junit
longrepr ends with the exception's name, so both `assert x == y` and an
explicit raise qualify. A NameError/ImportError/collection error never
does. Known one-way cost: `pytest.fail(...)` and a pytest.raises that DID
NOT RAISE report pytest's own Failed exception, not AssertionError, so
they land in broken_test — a missed gap, never a minted one, which is the
direction this gate is allowed to be wrong in.
