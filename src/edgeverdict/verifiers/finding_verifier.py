"""FindingVerifier — the deterministic judge for review findings.

A reviewer agent writes a test asserting some behavior the intent implies. This
runs that test against the branch and classifies the result. The classification
is the whole trust anchor, because a red test is ambiguous on its own:

    - PASS                 -> the tool already does the right thing  -> "handled"
    - ASSERTION failure    -> the tool did the WRONG thing           -> "confirmed_gap"
    - compile/load/crash   -> the TEST is broken, not the tool       -> "broken_test"
    - did not finish       -> nobody knows yet                       -> "timed_out"

The fourth bucket is deliberately NOT auto-resolved: a timeout is ambiguous
evidence (slow test? hung tool? starved sandbox?) and resolving ambiguity is
the human's job. The gate reports the limit it hit and stops. No retries,
no guessing — the board is where a person decides.

That third bucket is what keeps a red result meaningful: a model that writes a
garbage test must NOT be able to manufacture a "gap." Only a test that actually
runs and fails its assertion counts. No LLM is in this decision.

Note the honest ceiling: a confirmed_gap means the tool violated a *stated*
assertion that compiled and ran. It does NOT prove the assertion itself is the
*right* thing to assert — judging that is the second agent / human layer. This
gate confirms "the test is real and the tool fails it," nothing more.

This module owns the gate SEMANTICS only. Everything framework-specific —
injection, naming, run commands, output parsing, what counts as a named
assertion failure — lives behind the Harness seam (harness.py). The default
harness is vitest, so every existing caller is unchanged.
