"""The framework seam of the gate: everything a test framework decides.

FindingVerifier owns the *gate semantics* — warm sandbox, batch-then-serial
fallback, the four-verdict contract, and the conservative "no minted gaps"
rule. What it must NOT own is any opinion about vitest, because the next
repo is a pytest repo and the verdict logic is framework-independent by
design. This module names the boundary:

    RepoProfile  = repo facts       (install/build/test commands, env, smoke)
    Harness      = framework facts  (how to inject a test, how to name it,
                                     how to filter a run to it, how to read
                                     the runner's output, what a genuine
                                     assertion failure looks like)

A Harness answers exactly the questions the verifier asks per finding:

    inject          proposal code into the pristine tests file (PURE)
    strip_imports   the injection-legality rule for proposal imports
    test_title      the name the runner will know the proposal by
    mark_title      stamp a gate-owned mark into that name (batch attribution)
    serial_command  run ONLY one titled test, results to a file
    batch_command   run ONLY mark-stamped tests, results to a file
    read_verdict    one serial run's output -> (status, observed)
    read_batch      one batched run's output -> neutral per-test records
    classify_failure one failure message -> assertion | timeout | load_error
    default_tests_for the framework's test-file naming conventions

The classification hook is the load-bearing one: a confirmed_gap may only
ever come from a named assertion failure, and each framework spells its
assertion layer differently. The vitest spelling lives here now, moved
byte-for-byte from finding_verifier so the e2e fingerprint tests stay the
oracle that nothing observable changed.
