"""The vitest facts of the review path: repo profiles and execution helpers.

RepoProfile exists because a Python repo runs with one command (`pytest`)
but a JS repo does not: the package manager, whether sibling packages must
be built first, the project to scope to, and required env all vary per
repo. Pretending those are universal would make the gate *lie* on the next
repo. So every such fact is named explicitly in a RepoProfile. Supabase is
just one profile; a flat single-package repo is another. The harness core
never changes.

Alongside the profiles live the execution helpers every runner shares:
credential scrubbing (scrubbed_env), the frozen-install fallback
(unfrozen_install), vitest JSON parsing, and error-tail formatting.

Gotchas encoded (each found by actually running it against supabase/mcp):
  - `CI=true` (vitest.setup.ts stats .env.local otherwise; whole suite fails).
  - build workspace deps BEFORE tests (tests import built sibling packages).
  - `vitest run`, never bare `vitest` (bare = watch mode = hangs forever).
  - scope to a hermetic project; e2e/integration need live creds.
  - parse the JSON reporter, never stdout.

The legacy loop-protocol verifier that drove these facts (VitestVerifier,
with baseline-delta acceptance) lives in
``edgeverdict.experimental.verifiers.vitest_verifier``.

# model-written code) has any legitimate use for these. Scrubbing here
# enforces that design mechanically: even in CI, where the review step holds
# OPENAI_API_KEY, the code under test runs without it. Deliberately narrow —
