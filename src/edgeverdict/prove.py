"""prove: the author-side verb. An agent (or you) wrote code; prove tries
to break it and reports one line first: BROKEN, HELD, or STOPPED.

This module is the deliberately boring part: everything here is pure or
git-read-only, so the wording rules that make prove trustworthy are pinned
by unit tests, not by hope. The engine is untouched — cli.prove() builds a
ReviewRequest from a ProvePlan and api.run_review does what it always does.

Honesty rules (tested below in tests/test_prove_plan.py):
- "HELD" never claims correctness. It reports executed attempts that
  failed to break the change, and says so in those words.
- Zero executed attempts is never silently green. If nothing new ran, the
  line says what happened instead (covered / broken / nothing proposed).
- broken_test is edgeverdict's problem, not the user's: it appears as a
  parenthetical count, never in the headline.
